    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-text">
        <p>Welcome to Sunflower Holistic Therapies, where tranquillity meets expertise. 
            I'm Emily, a seasoned massage therapist with over a decade of experience and an HND qualification.
            Nestled in the serene surroundings of Newton Farm, near Cambuslang, my home-based salon provides a
            warm and inviting space for relaxation and rejuvenation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Specialising in a range of therapeutic techniques, I offer Swedish massage to unwind, aromatherapy
            massage for a sensory journey and hot stone massage for deep relaxation. Catering to the unique
            needs of expectant mothers, my prenatal massage provides gentle care during this special time.
            Experience the soothing benefits of Indian head massage, addressing both physical and mental well-being.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At Sunflower Holistic Therapies, each session is crafted to promote harmony and balance. Join me 
            on a holistic journey to wellness, where the art of massage meets personalised care.
